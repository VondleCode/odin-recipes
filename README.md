TOP: Basic recipe website project

Welcome to my first project for The Odin Project (TOP), creating a basic recipe website. While it definitely won't look particularly exciting, it'll cover the main lessons of TOP so far and hopefully give me a solid understanding of GIT as well as basic HTML. This website will consist of a main index page, with links to a few recipes. I'll also strive to have some meaningful commit messages to Git
